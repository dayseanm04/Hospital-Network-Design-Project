# ✅ Test – L3 EtherChannel Connectivity (DSW1 ↔ DSW2)

This test validates **Layer 3 (routed) EtherChannel connectivity** between **DSW1 and DSW2**.
This test is to verify that:

- LACP formed the Port-Channel correctly
- The Port-Channel is operating as a **Layer 3 routed link**
- End-to-end connectivity works across the EtherChannel

> 📌 Note: This test does **not** require dynamic routing to be configured.

## 🎯 Test Objective

| Objective | What I am Confirming |
|----------|-------------------------|
| EtherChannel is up | LACP bundle formed and is not suspended |
| L3 Port-Channel is routed | Port-Channel has an IP and acts as a routed interface |
| Basic connectivity works | DSW1 and DSW2 can reach each other across Po (Layer 3) |

## 🧪 Connectivity Tests (Ping)

### ✅ Ping Test Plan

| Test # | Source | Destination | Purpose |
|-------:|--------|------------|---------|
| 1 | DSW1 (Port-Channel IP) | DSW2 (Port-Channel IP) | Validate L3 EtherChannel connectivity |
| 2 | DSW2 (Port-Channel IP) | DSW1 (Port-Channel IP) | Confirm reverse direction |

Result: ✅ 

I was able to successfully ping the port channel

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Fixes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| Port-channel is down | Cabling mismatch / wrong interfaces | Verify physical connections |
| Ports show suspended | LACP mismatch or config mismatch | Ensure both sides use LACP `active` and same channel-group |
| Po is up but no ping | IP/dubnet mask mismatch | Verify Po IPs match same /30 network |
| One side L2, one side L3 | Missing `no switchport` on one side | Make Po and member ports L3 consistently |
