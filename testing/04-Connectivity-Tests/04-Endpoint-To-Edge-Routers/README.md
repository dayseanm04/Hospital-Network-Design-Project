# 🌐 04 – Endpoint to Edge Routers Testing

## 📌 Overview

This folder contains validation tests that verify **Layer 3 connectivity from hospital endpoints to the Edge Routers (HS-EDGE-R1 and HS-EDGE-R2).**

These tests confirm:

- Access → Distribution → Core → Edge routing path
- Edge loopback reachability
- Port-Channels connectivity
- Redundant Edge router paths

> 💡 These tests validate that hospital VLANs can successfully reach the Edge layer before external/WAN testing.
