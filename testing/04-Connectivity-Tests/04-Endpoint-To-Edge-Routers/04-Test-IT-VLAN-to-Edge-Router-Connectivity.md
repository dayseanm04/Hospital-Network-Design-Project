# 🧪 Test – IT VLAN to Edge Router Connectivity

## 📌 Purpose
This test verifies that the **IT Department VLAN (VLAN 240)** can successfully reach the **Edge Routers (HS-EDGE-R1 and HS-EDGE-R2)**.

### 💡 Successful replies confirm:
- Layer 3 routing from IT VLAN to Edge layer
- Redundant Edge router paths are operational
- Core-to-Edge connectivity is functioning correctly
