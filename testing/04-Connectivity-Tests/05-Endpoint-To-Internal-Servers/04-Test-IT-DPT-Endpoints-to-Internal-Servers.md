# 🧪 04 – Test IT Department Endpoints to Internal Servers

## 📌 Test Objective

Verify that IT Department endpoints can successfully reach internal servers located in the Server VLAN (VLAN 240 – 10.10.10.0/27).

This confirms:

- Inter-VLAN routing is operational
- OSPF is properly advertising VLAN subnets
- No ACL is blocking internal server access
