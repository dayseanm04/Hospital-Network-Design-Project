# 🧪 Test – IT VLAN to Distribution Connectivity

## 📌 Purpose
This test verifies that the **IT Department VLAN (VLAN 240)** can successfully reach the **Distribution Layer (DSW1 / DSW2)** including loopback interfaces and port-channels.

## 💡 Successful replies confirm:
- Layer 3 routing from IT VLAN to Distribution layer
- Redundant paths to DSW1 and DSW2
-  Proper core/distribution reachability
