# 🏗️ 03 – Endpoint to Distribution Testing

## 📌 Overview

This folder contains validation tests that verify **Layer 3 connectivity from hospital endpoints to the Distribution Layer (DSW1 and DSW2).**

These tests confirm:

- Access → Distribution routing path
- Distribution switch loopback reachability
- Port-Channel interface connectivity
- Redundant uplink paths

> 💡 These tests validate internal routing up to the Distribution layer before Core and Edge Layer validation.
