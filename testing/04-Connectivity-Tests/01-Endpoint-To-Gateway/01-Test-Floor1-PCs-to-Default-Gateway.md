# 🧪 Test – Floor 1 PCs to Default Gateway

## 📌 Purpose
This test verifies that **Floor 1 end devices** can successfully reach their **default gateway** within their respective VLANs.

> 💡 Although there are multiple PCs for the VLAN in this project, I will use **some PC sper VLAN** to validate connectivity and avoid repetition.
