# 🌐 Connectivity Tests – Hospital Network Design

## 📌 Overview

The **Connectivity Tests** folder contains all **network verification and validation tests** performed on the Hospital Network Design project.

These tests confirm that:
- Devices can communicate across **layers and VLANs**
- **Routing, redundancy, and security** configurations function as intended
- Critical hospital departments and services have **reliable network access**

**⚠️ Note:** This is **not the final testing phase**. Additional connectivity tests will be added as the project continues to evolve.

## 🎯 Purpose of Connectivity Testing

- ✅ Verify end-to-end network reachability  
- ✅ Validate routing paths


## 🧪 Testing Methods Used
- 📡 ICMP (Ping) tests
- 🔍 Interface & routing verification
- 🔗 EtherChannel status checks
- 🔐 Secure management access validation (SSH)
- 🧭 Gateway and inter-VLAN reachability tests

Screenshots, command outputs, and verification notes are included inside each test file.


This folder is designed to **grow as the network design matures**.


## 📝 Notes
All tests reflect the **current stage of implementation**.  
Results may change as configurations are refined or expanded in later stages.
