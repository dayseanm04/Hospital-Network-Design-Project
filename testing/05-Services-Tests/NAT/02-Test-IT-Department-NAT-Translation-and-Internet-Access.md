# 🌐 02 – Test IT Department NAT Translation and Internet Access

##  Overview

This test validates NAT functionality for IT Department endpoints.

Unlike other departments that use DHCP, IT endpoints are configured with **static IP addresses**.  
This test ensures that devices with static IP Addresses are correctly being translated to public IP addresses and can access external networks.
