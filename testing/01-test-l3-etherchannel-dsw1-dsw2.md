# ✅ Test – L3 EtherChannel Connectivity (DSW1 ↔ DSW2)

This test validates **Layer 3 (routed) EtherChannel connectivity** between **DSW1 and DSW2**.
This test is to verify that:

- LACP formed the Port-Channel correctly
- The Port-Channel is operating as a **Layer 3 routed link**
- End-to-end connectivity works across the EtherChannel

> 📌 Note: This test does **not** require dynamic routing to be configured.
