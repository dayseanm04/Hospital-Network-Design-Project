# ⚙️ Setup – Hospital Network Design

## 📌 Overview
The **setup** folder contains the **foundational implementation steps** for the Hospital Network Design project.  
These tasks focus on **building the physical topology**, **establishing core connectivity**, **configuring VLANs**, **assigning IP addresses**, and **preparing the network for services and security**.

---

## 🧱 Scope of This Folder
This folder covers:
- Physical and core connectivity
- Device identification (hostnames)
- VLAN creation and assignment
- End-device connectivity
- Inter-switch connections
- IP addressing for core and distribution layers
- Initial department and service network setup

**🔒 Note:** Advanced security configurations (ACLs, SSH hardening, management access) are documented in separate folders.

---

## 📝 Notes
- Tasks are ordered intentionally and should be followed **top-to-bottom**
- Verification and testing steps are documented in the [testing folder](/testing/)
- This setup forms the **baseline** for later routing, security, and services configurations

---

## ✅ Outcome
After completing all setup tasks, the hospital network will have:
- A fully connected three-tier architecture
- VLAN segmentation by department
- Proper IP addressing across core and distribution layers
- Ready infrastructure for security and management features
