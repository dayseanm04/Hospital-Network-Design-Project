# 🔌 Task 1 – Build Physical and Core Connections

This task focuses on building the **physical and logical connections** between the ISP, hospital core devices, distribution switches, and access switches.

I havent configured IP addressing or routing in this task.  
The goal is to ensure all devices are **properly connected and ready for configuration**.
