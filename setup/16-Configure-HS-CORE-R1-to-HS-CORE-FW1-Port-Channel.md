# 🔗 Configure HS-CORE-R1 to HS-CORE-FW1 Port-Channel

## 📌 Overview

In this task, I configure a **Layer 3 EtherChannel (static Port-Channel)** between the **HS-CORE-R1** and the **HS-CORE-FW1**.

This design removes the **single point of failure** created by a single uplink between the core and firewall.
