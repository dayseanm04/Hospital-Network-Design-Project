# 🌐 02 – Configure INET Services Network

In this task, I will configure the INET services network behind the INET edge router so the hospital network can access Internet services through ISP1. 

This includes configuring the LAN-facing interface, assigning static IP addresses to the servers, and setting basic device identity such as hostnames and interface descriptions.
