# 🌐 Configure Default Route on ISP1-R1

In this task, I will configure a **static default route** on **ISP1-R1** so traffic destined for **unknown external networks** can be forwarded upstream.  

This allows the **INET services network** and the **hospital network (via ISP1)** to reach each other over the simulated Internet.

## Topology For Reference
