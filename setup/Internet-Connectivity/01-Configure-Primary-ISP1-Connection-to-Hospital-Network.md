# 🌐 01 – Configure Primary ISP1 Connection to Hospital Network

## 📌 Overview

In this task, I will configure the **primary Internet connection between ISP1 and the hospital network**.  

Due to **Cisco Packet Tracer limitations**, EtherChannel cannot be configured on router platforms.  
To support **Layer 3 EtherChannel**, I used a **Layer 3 switch**.
