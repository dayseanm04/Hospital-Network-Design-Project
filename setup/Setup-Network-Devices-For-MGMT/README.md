# 🛠️ Setup Network Devices for Management  

## 📌 Overview

The **Setup Network Devices for Management** folder documents the **initial management-plane configuration** for all network devices in the Hospital Network Design project.

This phase focuses on preparing routers and switches for **secure remote administration**, ensuring that they can safely manage devices without relying on console access.

⚠️ **Note:**   This is **not the final**. Additional management and security enhancements will be added in later stages as the network design evolves.
