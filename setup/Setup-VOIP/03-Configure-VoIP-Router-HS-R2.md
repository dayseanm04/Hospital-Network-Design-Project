# 📞 Configure VoIP Router HS R2

## 📌 Overview

This task covers the **initial setup of the VoIP router (HS-R2)** used in the Hospital Network Design project.  

The router acts as the **voice gateway** and supports **Cisco telephony-service**, which is required for IP phones in Packet Tracer.

**⚠️ Note:**  
Although the hospital network is designed for many VoIP phones, only a limited number are deployed in the topology due to **Packet Tracer limitations**.
