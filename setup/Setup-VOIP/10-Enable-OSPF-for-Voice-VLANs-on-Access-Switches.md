# 🔊 Enable-OSPF-for-Voice-VLANs-on-Access-Switches

## 📌 Overview

In this task I will **OSPF routing** on the **Access Switches** to advertise **Voice VLAN** into the routing domain.  

This allows **end-to-end IP connectivity** between IP phones, the VoIP router, and the rest of the hospital network.

In all off the configurations I used **OSPF Process ID 1** and **Area 1**.
