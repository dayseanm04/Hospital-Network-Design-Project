# 🖧 Setup a Service Switch (Service-ASW)

## 📌 Overview
The **Service Access Switch (Service-ASW)** is used to connect and support internal network services such as **DHCP**.  
It acts as a dedicated switch for servers that provide essential services to the hospital network.

This setup step focuses on preparing the Service-ASW by:
- Assigning the hostname  
- Documenting physical connections to the distribution switches  
- Adding clear interface descriptions for easier management and troubleshooting  

### I will configure **EtherChannel**, and **Routing**, and in the [implementation-tasks](/implementation-tasks/01-Redundancy) section of this project. to keep the setup process organized and easy to follow.
