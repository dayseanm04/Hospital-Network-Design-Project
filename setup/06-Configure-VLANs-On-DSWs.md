# 🧩 06 – Configure VLANs on Distribution Switches (DSWs)

In this task I will configure VLANs on the **Distribution Switches (DSW1 and DSW2)**.

Because all Access Switches connect to the Distribution layer using **trunk links**,  
the Distribution Switches must have **all required VLANs created** so they can be carried across the trunks.

📌 In this task i will:
- Create VLANs on DSW1 and DSW2
- Name VLANs
- Ensure VLAN consistency across the distribution layer
