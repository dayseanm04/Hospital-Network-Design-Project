# 🌐 Configure IP addresses for HS-CORE-FW1 ↔ HS-CORE-R1

This document covers the point-to-point Layer 3 connection between the **Hospital Core Firewall (HS-CORE-FW1)** and 
the **Hospital Core Router (HS-CORE-R1)**.

✅ I used a **private IP subnet** for this link because it is an internal connection.  
📌 **Note:** Dynamic routing is **not configured yet** in this phase.
