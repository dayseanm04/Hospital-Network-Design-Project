# 🚨 Issue: OSPF Adjacency Stuck in EXSTART State

## 📌 Problem Description

After configuring **OSPF Area 0** across the hospital backbone, OSPF neighbor adjacencies involving the **core firewalls** failed to progress past the **EXSTART** state.

OSPF neighbors between Edge Routers and Distribution Switches formed successfully, but adjacencies to the Core Firewalls did not.
