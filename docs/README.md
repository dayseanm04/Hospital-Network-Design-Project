# 📚 Documentation – Hospital Network Design

## 📌 Overview

The **docs** folder serves as the **central reference library** for the Hospital Network Design project.

It contains **supporting documentation** used throughout the design, configuration, testing, and troubleshooting phases of the network.  
These documents provide **IP addressing plans, subnet references, loopback IPs, and point-to-point link details** to ensure consistency across the entire topology.

⚠️ **Note:** Thes documentation are **not final**. Additional reference files will be added as the project evolves and new design requirements emerge.
