# 🏥Hospital-Network-Design-Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **complete hospital network design and implementation** built in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

The goal is to design a **secure, reliable, and scalable enterprise network** that supports hospital departments, critical services, and IT management while following real-world networking best practices.

The project is organized in **stages**, starting from design and planning, then moving into implementation, security, testing, and troubleshooting.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Design a scalable hospital network architecture  
- Segment departments using VLANs and structured IP addressing  
- Implement redundancy for high availability  
- Secure the entire network using layered security controls  
- Verify functionality through structured testing  
- Document all decisions and configurations

## 🧠 Design 

- Three-tier architecture (core, distribution, access)
- Department-based VLAN segmentation
- Structured and scalable IP addressing
- Redundant links using EtherChannel
- Network security enforcement

---

## 🔐 Security Focus
Security is applied **across the entire network**, including:
- Device access protection
- Traffic control using ACLs
- Secure management access
- Segmentation between departments

I will add additional security features as the project evolves.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

Testing is organized into dedicated categories to verify that the hospital network operates correctly, securely, and reliably.

The testing phase validates **redundancy, failover behavior, security controls, and end-to-end connectivity** across the entire network. 

---

## 🔮 Project Status

🚧 **This project is actively evolving.**

New features, configurations, tests, and documentation will be added as needed to reflect real-world network growth and changes.
