# 🏥Hospital-Network-Design-Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **complete hospital network design and implementation** built in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

The goal is to design a **secure, reliable, and scalable enterprise network** that supports hospital departments, critical services, and IT management while following real-world networking best practices.

The project is organized in **stages**, starting from design and planning, then moving into implementation, security, testing, and troubleshooting.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Design a scalable hospital network architecture  
- Segment departments using VLANs and structured IP addressing  
- Implement redundancy for high availability  
- Secure the entire network using layered security controls  
- Verify functionality through structured testing  
- Document all decisions and configurations
