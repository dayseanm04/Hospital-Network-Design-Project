# 🔁 Redundancy – Hospital Network Design

## 📌 Overview
The **Redundancy** folder documents how **high availability and fault tolerance** are implemented in the Hospital Network Design project.

Healthcare networks must remain operational at all times.  
This section focuses on eliminating **single points of failure** by using **EtherChannel (LACP)**, **layered redundancy**, and **parallel paths** across the **core, distribution, and access layers**.

All configurations follow **enterprise networking best practices** and are designed for **scalability, resiliency, and uptime**.

## 🎯 Goals of Redundancy

- ✅ Ensure continuous network availability  
- ✅ Increase bandwidth using bundled links  
- ✅ Provide automatic failover if a link fails  
- ✅ Support mission-critical hospital services  
- ✅ Align with a **three-tier network architecture**

## 🧠 Design Highlights

- 🔗 **LACP (IEEE 802.3ad)** used for link aggregation
- ⚡ Increased throughput by bundling multiple physical links
- 🛑 Automatic failover if a link goes down
- 🏥 Built to support hospital-critical systems (EMR, servers, etc)
- 🧱 Fully integrated with the **core, distribution, and access layers**
