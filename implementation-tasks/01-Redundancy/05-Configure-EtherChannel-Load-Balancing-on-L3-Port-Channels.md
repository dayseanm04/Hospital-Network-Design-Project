# 🔀 Configure EtherChannel Load Balancing on L3 Port-Channels

## 📌 Overview
This task, I will configure **EtherChannel load balancing** for all **Layer 3 Port-Channels** in the network.

The **source–destination IP** load balancing method is used to ensure that packets belonging to the same traffic flow always use the same physical link within the Port-Channel.

## 🎯 Objective
- Configure a consistent load-balancing method across all devices
- Improve bandwidth utilization while maintaining packet order
