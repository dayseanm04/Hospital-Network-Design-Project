# ⚡ 01 – Enable STP PortFast on Access Switch Access Ports

In this task, I enabled **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) PortFast** on **access switch ports connected to end devices** (PCs, printers, etc.).  

PortFast allows access ports to transition immediately to the **forwarding state**, improving **end-device connectivity time** and overall network performance.

## 🎯 Objective

- ✅ Enable STP PortFast on all **access switch access port connected to PCs and Printers**
- ✅ Reduce STP convergence delay for user devices
- ✅ Apply configuration consistently across all access switches

## 🧠 Scope of Configuration

I enabled PortFast on the following **Access Layer switches**:

- `F1-ASW1`
- `F1-ASW2`
- `F2-ASW1`
- `F2-ASW2`
- `F3-ASW1`
- `F3-ASW2`


## ⚠️ Important Note

- **PortFast should only be enabled on ports connected to end devices.**
- It must **not** be enabled on trunk ports or ports connected to otherswitches, because it could network loops.

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps (Access Switches)

On each access switch, enter **interface range configuration mode** for ports connected to end devices:

```bash
interface range <start-interface> - <end-interface>
```
