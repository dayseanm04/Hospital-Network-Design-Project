# ⚡ 01 – Enable STP PortFast on Access Switch Access Ports

In this task, I enabled **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) PortFast** on **access switch ports connected to end devices** (PCs, printers, etc.).  

PortFast allows access ports to transition immediately to the **forwarding state**, improving **end-device connectivity time** and overall network performance.

## 🎯 Objective

- ✅ Enable STP PortFast on all **access switch access port connected to PCs and Printers**
- ✅ Reduce STP convergence delay for user devices
- ✅ Apply configuration consistently across all access switches
