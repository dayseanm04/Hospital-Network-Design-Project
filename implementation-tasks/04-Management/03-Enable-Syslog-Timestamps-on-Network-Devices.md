# ⏱️ 03 – Enable Syslog Timestamps on Network Devices

In this task, I will enable **timestamps on syslog messages** across all network devices.  
Including timestamps ensures logs clearly show **when events occur**, which is critical for **troubleshooting, monitoring, and auditing**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- ✅ Enable **date and time** on all syslog messages  
- ✅ Include **milliseconds** for precise event tracking  

---

## 🖥️ Devices

This configuration is applied to **all network devices**, including:

- Core Router (`HS-CORE-R1`)
- Distribution Switches (`DSW1`, `DSW2`)
- Access Switches (`F1-ASW1`, `F1-ASW2`)
- Access Switches (`F2-ASW1`, `F2-ASW2`)
- Access Switches (`F3-ASW1`, `F3-ASW2`)
- Service Access Switch (`Service-ASW`)
