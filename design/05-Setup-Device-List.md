# 📘 Device Inventory – Setup Overview

I will design the network using a Three-Tier Architecture to create a scalable and hierarchical network structure.
This architecture breaks the network into three layers: 

- Core: The high-speed backbone.
- Distribution: Aggregates data and enforces policies.
- Access: Connects end-user devices.

Note: I may be updated some of the devices as the project evolves (When its necessary).

# 🧠 1. Core Layer Devices (Tier 1)

These devices provide routing between VLANs, connect to the ISPs, and sit at the top of the network hierarchy.

### **Core Routers**

| Device Name | Model | Quantity | Role | Notes |
|-------------|--------|----------|------|-------|
| CORE-RTR1 | Cisco PT-Router | 1 | Main hospital router | Connects to ISP 1 |
