# 📘 Device Inventory – Setup Overview

I will design the network using a Three-Tier Architecture to create a scalable and hierarchical network structure.
This architecture breaks the network into three layers: 

- Core: The high-speed backbone.
- Distribution: Aggregates data and enforces policies.
- Access: Connects end-user devices.

Note: I may be updated some of the devices as the project evolves (When its necessary).
