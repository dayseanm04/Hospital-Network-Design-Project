# 🖧 01 – Network Requirements

Because hospitals rely on access to medical systems, patient records, and communication tools, the network must be **fast, secure, redundant, and highly available** at all times.

---

## 📌 1. High Availability

The hospital network must remain available 24/7.  
Requirements include:

- Redundant switches and routers  
- Failover paths for critical departments (ED, ICU, Imaging)  

High availability ensures that patient care systems and hospital applications stay online.

## 📌 2. Redundancy

Redundancy protects the network against hardware or link failures.  
The design must include:

- Redundant links 
- Backup routing paths  

If one device or link goes down, traffic should automatically reroute.
