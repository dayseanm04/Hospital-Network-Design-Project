This file represents the **initial network setup** which includes:

- **Layer 2 & Layer 3 EtherChannels** for link aggregation  
- **Redundancy** between core, distribution, and access layers  
- **Basic OSPF routing** for internal network connectivity  
- **Basic device security**, such as secure access and management setup  
- **VLAN segmentation** and **IP addressing** completed in earlier setup tasks  

This stage focuses on creating a **stable, redundant, and routable foundation** for the hospital network.
