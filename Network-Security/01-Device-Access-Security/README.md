# 🔐 Device Access Security

This folder contains step by step configurations used to **secure access to network devices** in the hospital network project.  
The goal is to protect the **management plane** by controlling how administrators access routers and switches.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Require **local username and password authentication**
- Protect **privileged EXEC mode** with an enable secret
- Secure **console and remote access** to devices
- Reduce the risk of **unauthorized access** to network infrastructure

## 🛡️ Notes

- Credentials used in this project are **simplified for lab purposes**
- In a real production environment, **strong passwords and additional controls** would be required
- These configurations are applied consistently across devices for **standardization**
