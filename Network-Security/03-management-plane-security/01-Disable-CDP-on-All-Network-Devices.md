# 🔒 Disable CDP on All Network Devices

In this task, I disabled **Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)** on all network devices in the hospital network to improve **security** and reduce **unnecessary control-plane traffic**.

By disabling CDP, devices no longer advertise information such as **hostnames, interface details, and platform types** to neighboring devices, which helps limit information exposure and slightly reduces CPU usage.
